# 🧠 tracing-rays

A dual-language exploration of ray tracing, implemented in both Rust and Python. This project dives into the fundamentals of rendering and language differences.

## 🛠️ Method

This repository contains Pythonic and Rusty implementations of the Ray Tracing Algorithm. Each folder focuses on using the strengths of the language to produce the resulting images.

## 🖼️ Viewing

For `.ppm` files, please use a compatible PPM viewer to visualize the rendered images.
